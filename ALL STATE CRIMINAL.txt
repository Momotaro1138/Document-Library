Penalty Details
Possession for Personal Use
S.B. 1201 was signed into law on June 22, 2021. The personal use provisions of the law 
took effect on July 1, 2021. It permits adults 21 and older to possess up to 1.5 ounces of 
cannabis flowers or an equivalent amount of cannabis concentrates in public, and up to five 
ounces of marijuana in their private residence. The measure limits the discriminatory 
actions that employers, hospitals, and others may take against those who test positive for 
past cannabis exposure. It also provides protections for parents and tenants who use 
cannabis in compliance with the law. The bill mandates that the odor of marijuana alone 
cannot be used as a basis for police to search an individual, and it prohibits jail time as a 
penalty for those under the age of 21 who are caught in possession of marijuana. Young 
adults (those ages 18 to 20) face civil penalties for marijuana possession. The use of 
cannabis in public remains subject to penalty.
Possession of up to 5 ounces in a locked container carries no penalty, no incarceration and 
no fine
Possession of more than 5 ounces is a civil infraction with a maximum fine of $500 for a 
first offense. A second offense is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 3 months 
incarceration and a maximum fine of $500.
Possession of 1.5 ounces in public is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year 
incarceration and a maximum fine of $2,000.
?	Connecticut Gen. Stat. § 21a-279a(a)(d)(e)
Distribution or Cultivation
Distribution or cultivation includes possession with intent to distribute or cultivate 
marijuana.
S.B. 1201 was signed into law on June 22, 2021. Home cultivation is permitted under the 
law, but adults are not legally permitted to engage in this activity until July 1, 2023. At that 
time, an adult can grow up to six plants or 12 plants per household. Until then, home 
cultivation remains prohibited and is punishable by civil fines. For home growing in CT prior 
to July 1, 2023, penalties for cultivating up to three mature and three immature plants are: 
(1) for a first offense, shall be issued a written warning, (2) for a second offense, shall be 
fined not more than $500, and (3) for any subsequent offense, shall be guilty of a class D 
misdemeanor punishable by 30 days incarceration and a maximum fine of $500.
For first offenders distribution or cultivation of less than 1 kilogram of marijuana is 
punishable by a fine of up to $25,000 and/or up to 7 years of imprisonment. Subsequent 
offenses are punishable by a fine of up to $100,000 and/or up to 15 years of imprisonment.
For first offenders distribution or cultivation of 1 kilogram or more of marijuana is 
punishable by 5-20 years of imprisonment. Subsequent offenses are punishable by up 10-
25 years of imprisonment. The court cannot reduce a sentence below the minimum years of 
prison time required by the statute, this means that first offenders face a minimum of 5 
years imprisonment and subsequent offenders a minimum of 10 years imprisonment. The 
court may make exceptions to these mandatory minimum sentences if the defendant is 
under 18 or is/was mentally impaired.
Distribution or cultivation of marijuana within 1,500 feet of an elementary/middle school, 
public housing project, or daycare center is punishable by an additional 3 years 
imprisonment on top of any other sentence imposed.
Distribution of marijuana by a person 18 years or older to a person under 18 is punishable 
by an additional 2 years imprisonment, on top of any other sentence imposed. There is an 
exception to this rule if the distributor is less than 2 years older than the minor.
Using a person under 18 years of age to assist in the sale of marijuana is punishable by 3 
years imprisonment, on top of any other sentence already imposed.

took effect on July 1, 2021. It permits adults 21 and older to possess up to 1.5 ounces of 
cannabis flowers or an equivalent amount of cannabis concentrates in public.
The Connecticut statute uses the terms "Marijuana" and "Cannabis-type substance" to refer 
to plant Cannabis or any substance made from or with Cannabis, including hashish or 
concentrates. The terms are given the exact same definition in the statute. The term 
"Marijuana" is used to distinguish "Marijuana" from other hallucinogenic substances, 
whereas the term "Cannabis-type substance" is used to define penalties for possession of 
said substances. The penalties for all infractions involving hashish or marijuana 
concentrates are therefore the same as the penalties for all infractions involving plant 
marijuana.

Penalty Details
Under Delaware law marijuana is a schedule I drug. Legislation was approved in 2015 
amending penalties for the possession of up to one ounce (28.35 grams) to a civil penalty, 
punishable by no more than a $100 fine. In 2019, legislation was approved expanding 
decriminalization to also include low-level possession offenses by juvenile offenders. In 
2023, legislation was enacted to remove the penalty for possession of up to one ounce of 
marijuana by adults aged 21 and over. The use of marijuana in public, or in a moving vehicle 
will remain a criminal offense.
Possession for Personal Use
Personal possession by adults aged 21 or older, of up to one ounce of marijuana is allowed 
by HB 1, passed in April 2023.  A person under the age of 21 who "knowingly or intentionally 
possesses, uses, or consumes a personal use quantity" marijuana must be assessed a 
$100 civil penalty for a first offense.
Possession of more than one ounce, but less than 175 grams of marijuana is an 
unclassified misdemeanor carrying a fine of $575. If there are one or more aggravating 
factors involved, possession is a class B misdemeanor.
Possession of 175 - less than 1,500 grams, Tier 1 Quantity, is a felony punishable by two 
years incarceration and fine at the discretion of the court.
Possession of 1,500 - less than 5,000 grams, Tier 2 Quantity, is a felony punishable by five 
years incarceration and fine at the discretion of the court.
Possession of 5,000 grams or more, Tier 3 Quantity, is a felony punishable by a mandatory 
minimum sentence of two years and up to 25 years incarceration, and fine at the discretion 
of the court.
Aggravating factors add increased incarceration.

a felony punishable by eight years incarceration and fine at the discretion of the court.
Distribution, Sale, or Manufacture of 1,500 - less than 5,000 grams of marijuana, Tier 2 
Quantity, is a felony punishable by 15 years incarceration and fine at the discretion of the 
court.
Distribution, Sale, or Manufacture of more than 5,000 grams of marijuana, Tier 3 Quantity, is 
a felony punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of two years and up to 25 years 
incarceration, and fine at the discretion of the court.
Aggravating factors add increased incarceration.
?	Delaware Code § 4754
?	Delaware Code § 4753(a)(b)(1)

Hash & Concentrates
The Delaware statute uses the general term "Marijuana" to refer to plant Cannabis and 
"every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture or preparation of the plant, its 
seeds or resin." Nowhere does the statute differentiate penalties for Marijuana and Hashish 
or Concentrates. Both substances are classified under Schedule I of the Delaware 
Controlled Substances schedule. April 2023 legislation allowed for the possession of up to 
12 grams of cannabis concentrate or cannabis products with up to 750 milligrams by adults 
aged 21 and over.
?	Delaware Code § 4701(28)
?	Delaware Code § 4714(d)(19)
Paraphernalia
April 2023 legislation removed penalties for the use and sale/delivery of paraphernalia 
items that are "used, or intended primarily for use, with marijuana."

Hash & Concentrates
Hashish is classified as a Schedule I drug in Idaho. The Definitions section of the statute 
includes Hashish and Marijuana Concentrates when it defines Marijuana as the plant and 
every derivative preparation of it. The Penalties section reinforces this interpretation by 
explicitly including, as Marijuana, any extract or preparation of cannabis which contains 
tetrahydrocannabinol. The statute never explicitly refers to Hashish or Marijuana 
Concentrates as being separate from Marijuana. Therefore, the penalties for hashish and 
THC concentrates should be the same as for marijuana. Please see the above marijuana 
section for further information.

not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, 
manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant or its seeds or resin." 
Hashish, hashish oil, and extracts clearly fall under this definition. Please see the 
marijuana penalties section for further details on Michigan's criminal sanction on 
cannabis.
An adult may possess up to 15 grams of marijuana concentrate.
An adult may transfer up to 15 grams of marijuana concentrate to another adult as long as 
there is no remuneration and the transfer is not advertised or promoted to the public.

several provisions in Initiative 90, including reducing the amount of cannabis plants that 
may be legally grown by an adult from four to two. As amended, those age 21 and older

Act (MRTA) into law. Provisions in the law legalizing the personal possession of up to

and older took immediate effect. The new law also establishes procedures for the 
automatic review and expungement of the criminal records of those with low-level 
cannabis convictions. Under the law, the smell of marijuana alone is no longer probable 
cause for a search by law enforcement. Use of cannabis in public may be subject to civil 
penalties.

punishable by a fine not to exceed $150. Possession of marijuana in excess of 1 pound -

Cultivation
* On March 31, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed The Marijuana Regulation and Taxation 
Act (MRTA) into law. Provisions permitting the home-cultivation of up to six cannabis 
plants per person (3 mature and 3 immature) and/or up to 12 plants per household (6 
mature/6 immature) take effect 18 months following the initiation of retail sales 
(approximately June 2024).
Growing over 6 (12 per household) cannabis plants is a class A misdemeanor and is 
punishable by up to 1 year of imprisonment and/or a fine of up to $1000.
*A person who cultivates marijuana in excess of 3 ounces of marijuana is also 
"possessing" marijuana under current case law. Parmeter v. Feinberg affirms the state's 
ability to charge a person with the crime of "cultivation" and "possession" any time a 
person is caught growing marijuana. This means the more marijuana that a person 
cultivates the more severe the degree of possession that the state can charge."
Hash & Concentrates
* On March 31, Governor Andrew Cuomo signed The Marijuana Regulation and Taxation 
Act (MRTA) into law. Provisions in the law legalizing the personal possession of up to 24 
grams of concentrates for those ages 21 and older took immediate effect.
The term 'Marihuana' as used in the New York Criminal code is defined as including both 
plant-form Marihuana and Concentrated Cannabis. Marihuana is listed as a Schedule 1 
drug on the New York Controlled Substances Schedule. Concentrated Cannabis is defined 
as the separated resin of the Cannabis plant, whether purified or raw, or any mixture or 
preparation containing at least 2.5% THC. Unlike most other states, New York uses the 
term Tetrahydrocannabinols exclusively to refer to synthetic cannabinoids, not 
Concentrates. New York does not apply its Marihuana decriminalization law to 
Concentrated Cannabis. There is no explicit justification for this in the statute, but specific 
penalties for offenses involving Concentrated Cannabis are separated from those 
involving plant-form Marihuana and the distinction is noted in caselaw.
Possession of up to 24 grams of concentrated cannabis is legal in New York.
Possession of more than 24 grams but less than 5 ounces of concentrated cannabis is a 
violation, punishable by a fine up to $150.
Possession of 5 ounces to 2 pounds of concentrated cannabis is a misdemeanor and 
punishable by imprisonment of 1 year and a fine of no more than $1,000. Possession of 2 
- 4 pounds of Concentrated Cannabis is a felony, punishable by up to 4 years 
imprisonment and a fine of no more than $5,000. Possession of over 4 pounds of 
concentrated cannabis is a felony punishable by up to 7 years imprisonment and a fine of 
up to $5,000. 
The presence of any controlled substance in an automobile creates a presumption of 
knowing possession for all occupants of the vehicle. This principle does not apply if the 
controlled substance is on the person of one of the passengers and the substance is 
hidden from the view of other passengers.
The presence of Marihuana (including Concentrated Cannabis) in open view in a room, 
other than a public place, under circumstances that evince an intent to manufacture, 
package, or otherwise prepare the Marihuana for sale gives rise to a presumption of 
knowing possession for all those in close proximity to the Marihuana at the time it is 
found.
?	New York Pen. Code §220.25
Sale of under 24 grams of Concentrated Cannabis is a violation, punishable by a fine up to 
$250. Sale of more than 24 grams is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 1 year 
imprisonment and a fine up to $1,000.
?	New York Pen. Code §222.45
?	New York Pen. Code §222.50
Sale of any amount of Concentrated Cannabis on a school bus, on the grounds of a child 
day care or educational facility, or in a publicly accessible area within 1000 feet of the real

Marijuana is a Schedule VI drug in TN.500,000200,000
?	Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-17-415 (2015) Web Search
Possession
Possession of a half ounce of marijuana or less is a misdemeanor punishable by up to one 
year in jail and maximum fine of $2,500. A $250 fine is required for all first time convictions. 
A subsequent offense brings a $500 mandatory minimum fine.
Gov. Bill Haslam signed HB 1478 into law, which will eliminate the provision that makes a 
third conviction for possession of marijuana a felony. The law took effect on July 1, 2016. 
This change will reduce the penalty for third-time possession from between one and six 
years of incarceration to less than one year in jail. In addition, having a misdemeanor rather 
than a felony record will reduce the collateral consequences associated with the conviction.

Possession
A majority of the Virginia legislature voted on April 7, 2021 to approve amendments to 
Senate Bill 1406 | House Bill 2312, which legalizes the personal use and possession of 
marijuana on July 1, 2021. Provisions in the law permit those age 21 and over to possess 
up to one ounce in public. Separate provisions in the law regulating the commercial 
production and retail sale of cannabis do not take effect until January 1, 2024.
"Adult sharing" of up to one ounce of marijuana or an equivalent amount of marijuana 
products between persons who are 21 years of age or older without remuneration is 
permitted under the new law. "Adult sharing" does not include instances in which marijuana 
is given away contemporaneously with another reciprocal transaction between the same 
parties; a gift of marijuana is offered or advertised in conjunction with an offer for the sale 
of goods or services; or a gift of marijuana is contingent upon a separate reciprocal 
transaction for goods or services.
In 2020, Governor Northam approved legislation (Senate Bill 2 | House Bill 972) 
decriminalizing marijuana possession offenses. It took effect on July 1, 2020. The law 
reduced penalties for offenses involving the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana to 
a civil violation - punishable by a maximum $25 fine, no arrest, and no criminal record, and 
established a rebuttable presumption that a person who possesses no more than one 
ounce of marijuana possesses it for personal use. It also explicitly seals past marijuana 
convictions from employers and school administrators. Separate legislation, SB 5013, 
signed into law in October 2020 permits those summoned to prepay their bill rather than 
having to appear in person for a court appearance.
Cultivation
A majority of the Virginia legislature voted on April 7, 2021 to approve amendments to 
Senate Bill 1406 | House Bill 2312, which legalized the personal cultivation of marijuana on 
July 1, 2021. Provisions in the law permits those age 21 and over to cultivate up to four 
plants per household at their primary place of residence. The law requires that no marijuana 
plant is visible from a public way without the use of aircraft, binoculars, or other optical 
aids, and that precautions are taken to prevent unauthorized access by persons younger 
than 21 years of age. To each plant must be attached a legible tag that includes the 
person's name, driver's license or identification number, and a notation that the marijuana 
plant is being grown for personal use.
Sale/Delivery
In VA, having a large quantity of marijuana is not proof of intent to distribute alone. 
Distributing more than one ounce of marijuana, but less than 5 pounds, is a Class 5 felony,

judge may use his discretion to sentence the offender to a term in jail for not more than 12

Distributing more than 100kg of marijuana is punishable with an automatic 20 years to life 
sentence, with 20 years being the mandatory minimum sentence. This mandatory minimum 
may be reduced by the judge if:
1.	the person does not have a prior conviction for an drug-related offense;
2.	the person did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or 
other dangerous weapon in committing the offense and did not convince another 
participant in the offense to do so;
3.	the offense did not result in death or serious bodily injury to any person;
4.	the person was not an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of others in the 
offense, and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise; and
5.	the offender cooperates with police and judicial officials by providing to the State all 
information and evidence the person has concerning the offense, but the fact that the 
person has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the 
Commonwealth already is aware of the information shall not preclude a determination 
by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.
A third sale or intent to distribute conviction brings a mandatory minimum sentence of 5 
years.
